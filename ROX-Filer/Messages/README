This directory contains various translations.
Set the environment variable 'LANG' to the name of a translation (without
the extension) before running the filer, eg:

	$ LANG=fr; export LANG
	$ ROX-Filer/AppRun

will cause the filer to display all messages in French.

See the ROX-Filer manual for details.
